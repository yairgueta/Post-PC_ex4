Answer to the question:
I've read that there is an option to change the system time of robolectric's run.
here: https://stackoverflow.com/questions/27803690/robolectric-how-can-i-set-time-that-i-want-the-calendar-class-returns
So I believe this is a good option to advance the time to 19 sec and 800 ms right after clicking the
button.
